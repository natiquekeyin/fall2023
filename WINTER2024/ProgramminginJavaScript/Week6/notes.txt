Objects and Object Oriented Programming(OOP):
 We work on Objects!
 Objects are a collection of "data/properties/features" and "operations that can be applied on the data".
 
String Objects and its functions:
Arrays:

let arr1=[1,2,3,4];
let arr2 = new Array(1,2,3,4);

Destructuring assignment:
let[username,domain]="johnsmith@gmail.com".split("@");


Array properties and Methods:
length
push()
unshift()

pop()
shift()

arr.concat([1,2,3],6);
arr.includes(3);

arr.join("").... converts an array to a String
"hello".split(e).. converts a string to an array...

Properties and methods:

var name="keyin";
var name2=new String("keyin College");

console.log(name.length);
console.log(name.toUpperCase());


Methods to traverse elmements in an array

1. for loop
2. forEach( )
3. map()
4. find() .. finds and returns an element from the array which matches a condition you define ...
5. filter( )... creates and returns a new array containing only those elements that match a condition you define in your function

Regular Expressions:

 These are patterns that we define to manipulate strings.
 Manipulation means finding, replacing,converting etc etc of strings..

 colou?r

 color --correct
 colour ---correct

 let re=/colou?r/;
 let re2 = new RegExp('colou?r');

 Period
 . means any letter in RE..
 [] represents a set of letters, one of which shoud be ther...
 ^ when used in [] will reverse...
 \d Any number (digit)
 \D NOT THE DIGIT
 \w [a-zA-Z0-9_] a word .. consists of all these..
 \s is one space..
 ? refers to an optional character...
 * .. 0 or more ...
 + .. 1 or more 
 { } in which we can mention the exact number of somethig.
 ( )paranthesis in RE represent "Capture group".. Details soon...
 ^ represents the start of the Regular expression 
 $ represents the end of it...

 Our phone number regular expression: /(\(?\d{3}\)?[-\s]*)?\d{3}[-\s]*\d{4}/

 .test() tests the given RE with the passed string and returns true or false...
