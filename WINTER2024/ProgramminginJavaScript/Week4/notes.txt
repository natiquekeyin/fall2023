Review of Last weeks!

Statements: 
 In most of languages,statements end at a semi colon ";"{statement terminator}.

Blocks:
 block is a combination of { .{ ... }... }

Functions:
  Primary building block of JavaScript.Reusable piece of codes that we write once and use as many times as we want...

  function foo( ){   }
   keyword
   name of the function [foo] 
   () The paranthesis tell us that foo is a function, paranthesis consist of the list of parameters that a function will accept.
   { } The body of the function...

   function juicer(apples){ xxxxxxx.... return juice;}

   JUICER IS A FUNCTION THAT ACCEPTS APPLES AND RETURN JUICE.

   function juicer( ){ return juice;}
   function juicer(oranges){    }

Variables:
    var, let or const keywords are used to define variables in javascript..

    var has a function level scope
    let has a block level scope...
    const has a constant value.. CAN NOT BE CHANGED...
  
Data types in JavaScript:
 1. Number 
 2. String

Operators:
 +
 - 
 *
 / 
 %

 ++ Increment  
 -- Decrement 
 Pre increment/Decrement
 Post increment/decrement

 Assignment: =
 x=10;
 Equality: ==
 if(x==10)

 coercion!

 === "strict equality operator"...

 What is an expression????
         Something that evaluates to a value
         2+2   -> 4
         x+5    -> add 5 to x
         x==5    -> true.. false

         let x=10; //equation??
        R.H.S or L.H.S of an equation is an expression...

 Functions:
  A subprogram, or a smaller portion of code that can be called (i.e invoked) by another part of your program, or by another function or by the environment to some user actions...(clicking a button might call a function and so on...)

  UDF: User defined Functions
  PDF: Pre-defined functions

  User Defined Functions:
    Functions written by users...

    Three forms of UDFs:
      i) Function Declarations
      ii) Function expressions
      iii) Arrow Functions... 
    
    1. Function Declarations:


      function foo(){

      }

      function square(n){
        return n*n;
      }

      function add(a,b){
        return a+b;
      }

      foo(); //calling the function
      square(5); // return 25
      add(1,2); //return 3
    
    2. Function Expressions:

    let foo = function(){   };

    let square = function(n){ return n* n};

    let add = function(a,b){
      return a+b;
    }
