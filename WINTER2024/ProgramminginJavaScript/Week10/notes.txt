Two frameworks for fullstack development:
    1. MEAN (MongoDB, Express JS, Angular, Node JS)
    2. MERN (-, -, React, -)

2."R" is used to develop user interfaces:
    HTML+CSS+JavaScript = React JS

.gitignore: 

everything in this file will be ignored while pushing the changes to the github repositbory.

NEVER EVER PUSH OR SEND(TO ME) YOUR NODE MODULE FOLDER!! NEVER NEVER....

ONE SHOULD ALWAYS IGNORE(REMOVE) THE NODE_MODULES FOLDER AND THEN SEND YOUR PROJECT.... (I DEARLY HOPE SO)

BUT NEVER FORGET TO SEND YOUR "package.json"!!

When the react project is sent, node_modules is not included. On receving side, we need to "npm install" that will read "package.json" and produce back the node_modules folder.

MPA /SPA


index.html (has #root div)
index.js accesses the root div and creates a ReactDOM root...
and by using root object it renders a component (<App/>).

Components:
<App/> component:
each component returns "JSX"...

JSX is actually a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

We use JSX to show the output on our components!
