Topics from Students:
    1. Syntax of Loops in JS (almost all languages)
    2. Ternary operator(short form of if else)
    3. Truthy and falsy (new topic - we may discuss during regular class)
    4. Arrow functions (comfortability with it??) - handling the missing arguments/ handling the missing return


    For loop in JS:

    let x=1; //Yes ..
    x=2; // Yes..

    for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
    {

        
    }
