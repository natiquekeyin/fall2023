Props: properties are like parameters that we pass to the components.

defaultProps provide default vaalues..

and PropTypes provide the type as well as required value for props...

Generally in CSS we have kebab case..

background-color (Remember??)

Styling in JSX:

All those properties are written in camelCase...

The functions also can be passed as Props to the components!
