Props: properties are like parameters that we pass to the components.

defaultProps provide default vaalues..

and PropTypes provide the type as well as required value for props...

Generally in CSS we have kebab case..

background-color (Remember??)

Styling in JSX:

All those properties are written in camelCase...

The functions also can be passed as Props to the components! 

State of a component:
 1. class components -> State
 2. Function components -> Hooks!

 HOOKS!
 1. useState() Hook:
    Keeps track of the state of the component(the values carried forward by the variables in the component)


setPerson({name:"Bob"}) ??? 

 {/* <Temp1 /> */}
      {/* <Temp2 /> */}
      {/* <Temp3 /> */}

To make tasks state variable GLOBAL, we need to put that into our App component which is always the home/first component to run...Ultimately passed to the concerned components when needed...
