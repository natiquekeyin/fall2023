API - (Application Programming Iterface)
 My website will talk to Keyin website through that API..

DOM: Document Object Model
 is an API that makes communication between HTML,CSS and Javascript...

DOM Tree:
The html loaded in the browswer memory is in form of a tree called DOM tree.
DOM Nodes: (All elements within html document)

Programming the DOM:
    Webpages are dynamic: they can change in response to user actions, different data, javaScript code etc...
    
    DOM always keeps the current or actually content of the page as it exiss right now in your browser...

    Question: HOw does one modify a web page after it is rendered in teh browser...
    Answer: DOM 


    DOM is a programming interface(i.e; set of Objects, fuctions and properties..)


    DOM accomplishes a number important tasks:

    1. Finding and getting the references to the elements in the page...

    2. Creating, adding, and removing elements from the DOM Tree..

    3.Inspecting and modifying elements and their content..

    4. Run code in response to events triggered by the user, browser or other parts of code.

    1. Finding elements in the DOM with JavaScript:
        a. by using document object: it will only find generalized sub components...
        b. getElementById('id');
        c. querySelector(selectors)  & querySelectorAll(selectors);
            selectors: 1. Tag names, 2. ID, 3. Class name
