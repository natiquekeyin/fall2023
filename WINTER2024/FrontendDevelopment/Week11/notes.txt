Week11:
 Prototypal Inheritance: A classical way of implementing objects in JS.(NOT INCLUDING CLASSES DIRECTLY)

 ES5, ES6 introduced the concept of Classes and objects...more close to the OOP..(object Oriented Programming)

Other then JavaScript! all OOP languages define constructor with the SAME name as class:

In othe languages:

class Book{

    Book(){

    }
}


// class Book {} // a class is a blue print in which we dfine our data and functions...

// let objBook = new Book(); //we create object to use the classes' properties....

class Book {
  // special function called "constructor function" that is used to initialize the values of class...

  constructor(a, b) {
    this.x = a;
    this.y = b;
  }

  someFunction() {
    this.x = 10;
    this.y = "Alan SMith";
  }
}

let objBook = new Book();

// objBook.someFunction();

console.log(objBook);
