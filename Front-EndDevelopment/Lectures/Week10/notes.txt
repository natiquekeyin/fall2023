We want some code to wait for other code execution for accurate/current data...

To do asynchronous programming in javaScript
    1. callback functions...
    2. Promises ...(Just like real world promises...fullfilled..notfullfilled)
        resolve(); // promise fullfilled
        reject(); // promise not fullfilled...
    3. Async/await ...


AJAX based techniques: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML:

1. XmlHttpRequest (XHR) Object:
    API to acheive, A way to tranfser data between client and server.. it can work with data like JSON, plain text etc.

    API endpoints: Diffent websites provide API endpoints throught which we can get data out of those sites..
    a) Keyin schedule - keyin will provide an api endpoint to read that. For example: www.keyin.com/schedule/all
    b) BBC tweets- www.twitter.com/bbc/tweets ... 
    c)  www.facebook.com/manny/friendslist

2.FetchAPI (it returns promises)
